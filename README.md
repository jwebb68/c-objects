C-objects
---------

A library of code that shows how to use structs in a way that mimics C++ or
Rust, but in a very manual way (e.g YOU control lifetimes).

As such it's got plenty of footguns in it (probably about the same as any C project then).

If you want one with fewer footguns compared C, use Rust.
If you want one with different footguns compared to C, use C++.
